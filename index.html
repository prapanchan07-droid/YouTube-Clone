Sport may provide enjoyment to participants and entertainment to spectators
        <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport#cite_note-council-2">[2]</a></sup> The number of participants in a particular sport can vary from hundreds of people to a single individual.</p>
        <p>Sport competitions may use a team or single person format, and may be open, allowing a broad range of participants, or closed, restricting participation to specific groups or those invited. Competitions may allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure there is only one winner. They also may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>
